Code for the MUN AI and Games Lab Sandbox project

# Installation

This program uses sfml and opencv, which must be installed separately.
For sfml you must create an environment variable called SFML_DIR pointing towards the sfml directory.
For opencv you must use opencv 4.8.0, and add the opencv\build\x64\vc16\bin directory to the environment path variable.
